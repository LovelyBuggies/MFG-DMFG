# Learning Dual Mean Field Games on Graphs

These are the source codes for paper "Learning Dual Mean Field Games on Graphs".

## File Structure

- ecai-algo1 contains the source codes for Algorithm 1.1 and 1.2 in the paper. 3d population density graphs for Braess network, convergence gap and W1-distance graphs also use this project.
- ecai-algo2 contains the source codes for Algorithm 2 in the paper. 3d population denstiy graphs for Sioux-Falls network, convergence gap and W1-distance graphs also use this project.
- braess.pptx contains the source file for figure 1. In this paper, we focus on the path (1->2->3->4), (1->3->4) and (1->2->4).
- Sioux-falls.jpeg is the modified single-edge version of Sioux-falls network. In this paper, we focus on the path (1->3->4->5->9->10->16->17->19->20) and (1->2->6->8->7->18->20).
